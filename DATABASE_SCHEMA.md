## Relationships

-   **One-to-Many**: One `Recipe` can have multiple `RecipeImage` entries (one per PDF page)
-   **One-to-Many**: One `Recipe` can have multiple `DishImage` entries
-   The web GUI displays images from `RecipeImage` where `pdf_page_number = 0` (page 1) for each recipe
-   Rotation is stored per image in both `RecipeImage` and `DishImage` tables, allowing different rotations for different images
